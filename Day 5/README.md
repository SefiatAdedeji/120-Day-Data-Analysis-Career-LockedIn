# Day 5 - Portfolio Strategy (Project Idea Bank)  
**Task:** List 5 business problems I could solve with data.

---

## Overview  
Today, I created a project idea bank by listing business problems that can be solved using data.

The goal of this task is to build a portfolio that is:
- business-focused,
- realistic,
- and aligned with what companies actually need from Data Analysts.

## 5 Business Problems I Could Solve With Data  

### 1. Sales Performance Decline  
**Problem:** Sales have dropped and the business needs to understand why.  
**Data Needed:** Sales transactions, product data, customer segments, time period.  
**Possible Insights:** Best/worst performing products, seasonal trends, region performance, customer retention.

### 2. Customer Churn / Retention Issues  
**Problem:** Customers are leaving and the company wants to reduce churn.  
**Data Needed:** Customer profiles, purchase history, support tickets, subscription activity.  
**Possible Insights:** Churn patterns, high-risk customer segments, drivers of churn.

### 3. Marketing Campaign Effectiveness  
**Problem:** Marketing spend is increasing but results are unclear.  
**Data Needed:** Campaign data, conversion data, web traffic, customer acquisition cost.  
**Possible Insights:** ROI per campaign, best channels, conversion funnel drop-offs.

### 4. Inventory & Stock Management  
**Problem:** The business experiences stock-outs or overstocking.  
**Data Needed:** Inventory levels, sales demand, supplier lead time, product categories.  
**Possible Insights:** Demand forecasting, fast vs slow-moving items, reorder level optimization.

**Data Needed:** Performance metrics, engagement surveys, attendance, exit interview data.  
**Possible Insights:** Engagement drivers, department trends, retention risk factors.

## Outcome  
This task helped me shift my thinking from “project ideas” to “business problems.”

Instead of building dashboards randomly, I now have problem-driven project directions that can demonstrate real analytical value.

---

## Next Steps  
- Select 1–2 problems from this list to develop into full portfolio projects  
- Identify datasets (public or generated) that match each problem  
- Write clear project scopes (goal, metrics, deliverables) before building
