# Day 3 - Analytics Process (Applying the Analytics Lifecycle to Real Work)  
**Task:** Take a past project and identify gaps using the analytics lifecycle.

---

## Overview  
Today, I revisited one of my past data analysis projects and assessed it using a structured analytics lifecycle.

The purpose of this task was to evaluate whether my project followed the full end-to-end analytics process — not just the technical steps — and to identify gaps that could reduce business value or clarity.

---

## Project Reviewed  
I reviewed a previous analysis project where I explored data, built insights, and presented results using charts and summaries.

---

## Analytics Lifecycle Used  
For this review, I assessed the project using a simple analytics lifecycle framework:

1. Business Understanding  
2. Data Understanding  
3. Data Preparation  
4. Analysis & Modeling  
5. Visualization & Communication  
6. Recommendations & Action  
7. Evaluation & Feedback

## Gaps Identified (Lifecycle Review)

### 1. Business Understanding  
**What I did well:**  
- I had a general idea of the goal.

**Gaps noticed:**  
- The business question was not clearly written.
- The decision the analysis was meant to support was not explicitly stated.

---

### 2. Data Understanding  
**What I did well:**  
- I explored the dataset and checked columns.

**Gaps noticed:**  
- I did not document dataset context properly (source, time period, limitations).
- I did not clearly define key metrics or terms early.

---

### 3. Data Preparation  
**What I did well:**  
- I cleaned missing values and corrected data types.

**Gaps noticed:**  
- Cleaning steps were not documented in a reproducible way.
- I did not track assumptions or transformations clearly.

---

### 4. Analysis & Modeling  
**What I did well:**  
- I performed descriptive analysis and comparisons.

**Gaps noticed:**  
- Some analysis choices were not justified.
- I did not include validation checks to confirm the findings.

---

### 5. Visualization & Communication  
**What I did well:**  
- I created charts and dashboards.

**Gaps noticed:**  
- Visuals were not always tied back to a decision.
- The story flow could have been clearer (problem → insight → impact).

---

### 6. Recommendations & Action  
**What I did well:**  
- I stated observations.

**Gaps noticed:**  
- Recommendations were not clearly written as actionable next steps.
- I did not define what success would look like after implementing changes.

---

### 7. Evaluation & Feedback  
**What I did well:**  
- I concluded the project after insights.

**Gaps noticed:**  
- No clear evaluation stage.
- I did not include stakeholder feedback, next questions, or follow-up analysis.

---

## Outcome  
This review helped me understand that my past work was technically solid, but incomplete from a business and communication perspective.

The biggest gaps were not about tools — they were about:
- clarity of business context,
- documentation,
- decision-driven storytelling,
- and actionable recommendations.

---

## Next Steps  
Going forward, I will improve my projects by:

- Writing the business question clearly before analysis  
- Documenting data sources, assumptions, and limitations  
- Making every chart answer a specific question  
- Ending each project with clear recommendations and next steps  
- Including an evaluation section (what to track after implementation)
