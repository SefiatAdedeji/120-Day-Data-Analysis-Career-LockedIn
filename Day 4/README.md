# Day 4 - Skills Audit (Tool Knowledge vs Execution Ability)  
**Task:** Rate yourself (Excel / BI / SQL / Python), note execution gaps, and review my Medium account.

---

## Overview  
Today, I carried out a personal skills audit to evaluate the difference between:

- What I **know** (tool familiarity)
- What I can **execute confidently** (real task performance)

This helps me identify where I need more practice, not just more learning.

## Skills Self-Rating (Current Level)

| Skill Area | Self-Rating | Notes |
|----------|------------|------|
| Excel | Intermediate | Comfortable with formulas, cleaning, and quick analysis. Need more speed and advanced functions. |
| SQL | Intermediate | Can write queries, joins, filters, and aggregations. Need stronger optimization and complex query confidence. |
| Power BI | Intermediate | Can build dashboards and basic models. Need stronger DAX, data modeling, and storytelling. |
| Python | Beginner | Understand basics. Need more practice with data cleaning, analysis workflows, and real project usage. |

## Execution Gaps Identified  
The biggest gaps I noticed are not about knowing the tools — but about:

- Speed and confidence when working under pressure  
- Handling messy datasets end-to-end  
- Stronger data modeling and DAX in Power BI  
- Applying Python consistently in real analysis projects  
- Communicating insights clearly and linking them to business decisions  

---

## Medium Account Review  
I also reviewed my Medium account today as part of improving my professional presence.

The goal is to use Medium to:
- document my learning publicly,
- share projects and insights,
- and strengthen my personal brand as a data professional.

---

## Next Steps  
- Create practice tasks to improve execution speed (Excel + SQL)  
- Start a weekly Power BI mini-dashboard challenge  
- Use Python in at least one project this month  
- Publish at least one Medium article during this 120-day challenge
