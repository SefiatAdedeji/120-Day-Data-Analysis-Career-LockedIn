# Day 1 - Review of 3 Data Analyst Job Descriptions  
**Task:** Review 3 Data Analyst job descriptions and highlight *used vs known* skills.

---

## Overview  
Today, I reviewed three Data Analyst job descriptions to better understand the difference between:

- **Skills commonly listed as requirements**
- **Skills most likely used in day-to-day work**

The goal was to identify what employers *say they want* versus what the job responsibilities *actually demand consistently*.

---

## Key Findings (Used vs. Known Skills)

### Most Frequently Used Skills (Core / Daily)  
Across all three roles, the responsibilities strongly pointed to these as the most used skills:

- **SQL** — querying, extracting, and validating data  
- **Excel** — quick analysis, cleaning, summaries, and ad-hoc reporting  
- **Power BI / Tableau** — building dashboards, reports, and visual insights  
- **Data Cleaning & Quality Checks** — ensuring accuracy before reporting  
- **Basic Business & Performance Metrics** — tracking KPIs and outcomes  

---

### ⭐ Often Listed, But Less Central (Nice-to-Have)  
These skills appeared in the job requirements, but were less emphasized in daily responsibilities:

- **Python** — mostly described as an added advantage  
- **Advanced Statistics** — mentioned, but not consistently required  
- **Machine Learning** — occasionally listed, but rarely part of core duties  

This suggests that many companies value these skills, but they are not always essential for the typical Data Analyst workflow.

---

## What Stood Out Most  
Interestingly, the most consistent “must-have” skill across all three roles was not a tool — it was the ability to work with people and drive decisions.

The following skills showed up repeatedly in different forms:

- **Stakeholder communication**
- **Translating data into insights**
- **Problem-solving**
- **Supporting business decisions**
- **Working cross-functionally with teams**

---

## Outcome / Reflection  
This review reinforced an important lesson:

> Data analytics isn’t about listing every tool on your CV.  
> It’s about mastering a few core tools, understanding the business problem, and communicating insights clearly.

It also helped me see that a strong Data Analyst is defined by **impact**, not tool collection.

---

## Next Steps  
Based on today’s findings, my focus going forward will be:

- Strengthening my **SQL** skills for real-world querying  
- Practicing faster analysis workflows in **Excel**  
- Building more decision-driven dashboards in **Power BI**  
- Improving how I explain insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders
